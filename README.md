### About me
Java Core, Spring, Spring Boot, Hibernate, Maven, SQL, Databases, PostgreSQL, H2, Postman, Data Structures, Algorithms, JUnit Testing, Mock Testing, Git, GitHub, Docker, IntelliJ IDEA.

I have been interested in software development for many years and took my first steps in this direction back in college in 2003 when we were taught a course on Visual Basic. I always tried to do more than what was given to us. I found programming more interesting than my main field of study. Nevertheless, I graduated with a degree in "Energy Machine Engineering" and then started working, although not in my specialty.

I have always been drawn to information technologies, and as a result, I have almost always worked with it. When I realized that I was experiencing professional burnout because my main activity had become administrativeâ€”something that I didn't particularly enjoyâ€”I decided to dive deeper into the world of information technology. I obtained a second degree in "Computer Science and Computing Technology," graduating with honors. Unfortunately, during the pandemic year of 2020, I did not manage to radically change my career.

However, in 2024, I came to the realization that it was time to move forward. I approached the choice of programming language very thoroughlyâ€”I read a large number of articles and tried to write several projects. I enjoyed it. In November 2024, I completed the "Yandex.Practicum" Java Developer course. The training helped me realize what I was missing in my previous jobâ€”creativity. When I write code in Java, I feel that I am truly creating something unique that contains a part of me as a developer and a person. I also really enjoyed interacting with my classmates. I like helping them understand complex issues and receiving mutual assistance from them. My good command of English has greatly helped me fully grasp the course material, as I can access all foreign documentation.

I constantly read articles on Habr dedicated to development, including Java. Currently, I am working on a pet project to help a friendâ€”an application that processes regular reports from a healthcare union organization, which are initially formatted in MS Excel. I plan to integrate the Apache POI framework for working with MS Office files and to try creating a graphical interface using JavaFX at first, and then attempt to develop a web interface.

To better understand algorithms during the course, I read the book "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava. I am also currently finishing the book "Java Volume 1: Fundamentals" by Cay Horstmann, which was gifted to me by former colleagues. To understand the nuances of the Java language and the development processes, I regularly watch tutorial videos on various platforms and communicate with established developers and project managers. In particular, it so happens that my best friend is one of those managers in Japan.

I regularly attend conferences in my city dedicated to development, where I meet new interesting teams and professionals.

In addition to programming, I am also passionate about music. I compose music, which is also a form of programming. Based on my music, a good friend of mine staged a play that has been running in Kaliningrad for several seasons. I have collaborated with various musicians so many times that I can no longer count themâ€”I can be found on all streaming platforms as Oleg Lazarenko.
